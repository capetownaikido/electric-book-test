# **1** Hello World

Start here.

Here are my second thoughts. It seems that this might just work...
Yes! It's working!!!
Ok, now I'm checking that my new code works. I doubt it will... no, actually it should...
Hi, these are some thoughts from me at Cape Town Aikido.
I really think your book would benefit by adding in my considerations. They are quite intelligent. At least, that's what I think...

I would like to add some other things here.

For a second Pull Request, I am going to put some more code here. I'm wondering, off the cuff, whether integrating so tightly into GitHub makes the most sense. 
If we use the GitHub API less, we could do more with git, and be `platform independent`. I also need to set word-wrap on the CodeMirror editor.
